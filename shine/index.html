					<h2 class="whiteT">Shine</h2>
					<p class="whiteT">Shine is Puzzle/Horror game that takes place in the year 1960. Set in the Northern Reaches of New England, the main character searches for a missing friend after he receives a series of discomforting letters. Beginning as a friendly investigation you quickly become wrapped up in events much deeper and darker than initially anticipated. You are stranded in an isolated forest with only a lantern for light. You're Alone?</p>
					<h2 class="whiteT">My Role</h2>
					<p class="whiteT">During Shines intimal development I served as the Lead Designer, Lead Writer, Co-Developer and Team Leader. I also wrote and recorded all music/sound in Shine.</p>

					<h2>Game Development</h2>
					<p>Shine was developed over a 2-week period with two other developers. It is a point and click adventure built in C# that utilizes Microsoft Kinect. Before each level, the player is presented with a riddle which hints to a forthcoming puzzle solution. The player must than explore various environments, find clues and ultimately complete a puzzle to continue. The catch is, you are stranded in the dark. Using your hands, the player controls a lantern which illuminated a small section of the environment. This enables you to search for clues and interact with the scenery.</p>

					<p>The greatest challenge associated with Shines development was the 2-week deadline our team had to meet. From the start, Shine had a very large scope and that weight often pressured us during development.</p>
